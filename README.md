# Restaurant-Data-Analysis(A/B Testing and Revenue Prediction)
Restaurant tablets allow customers to browse the menu, place orders, play games, and pay their bill right from their seat. 
When the devices are installed in a restaurant (“go-live date” in the workbook) they influence customer behavior and subsequently 
the restaurant’s bottom line.  
The first tab of the workbook contains daily totals for net sales, number of POS checks, and labor costs for 14 restaurants over a 15-month 
period. The second tab contains additional information about each restaurant including the state the restaurant is located in, 
the franchise group it belongs to, as well as the “go-live” date for when the device was installed. 
Restaurants with an “n/a” in the go-live column never had the devices installed and may be thought of as a control group.  
We analyze the impact of the introduction of the device using A/B Testing. 
Additionally, restaurant makes money from selling games and is interested in being able to accurately predict our revenue. 
Using the dataset, we create a predictive model of Game Revenue based on variables
